=====================================================================
 maildirwatch - Watch Maildir for new mail and display notifications
=====================================================================

This program allows you to watch a Maildir_ for incoming email and display
notifications when new messages arrive.

The displayed notifications are interactive - programs can be run when the user
clicks on them.

Installation
============

Installation from PyPI::

  pip3 install --user maildirwatch

Python3 is required.

**Note**: PyGObject_ is a dependency of this program.  To install it, you might
have to install GObject development libraries on your system.  On Debian, the
package ``libgirepository1.0-dev`` provides these libraries.

Usage
=====

Use the ``maildirwatch`` command, or::

  python3 -m maildirwatch

The program will run forever or until you interrupt it with `Ctrl-C`.

To list available options, run::

  maildirwatch --help

Configuration
=============

The program looks for the configuration file in
``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/maildirwatch.conf`` or ``~/.config/maildirwatch.conf`` if
``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` is not defined.

The configuration file is in Python's standard config format (understood by the
``configparser`` module).

Global options
--------------

These options should be put in the ``[global]`` section.

* ``maildir``

  The directory to scan for maildirs.  Default value: ``~/Maildir``.

* ``ignore``

  Comma-separated list of maildir patterns to ignore.  Each pattern must be in
  fnmatch_ style.  By default, no maildirs are ignored.

Actions
-------

Each action is a path to a program and a list of arguments.  Every action also
has a name that is displayed to the user.

Actions are typically displayed as text buttons below the notification body.
When the user clicks on the action button, the action program is started.

Action definitions must be put in ``[actions]`` section.  Each action is
defined like this::

  action name = /path/to/program arg1 arg2 arg3...

One action name is special - the ``default`` action.  The default action's
value should be the name of another action instead of path to a program.  The
program associated with default action is run when the user clicks on the
notification itself, not an action button.

Example configuration
---------------------

Below is an example configuration file that modifies path to the Maildir,
ignores spam folder and defines two actions::

  [global]
  maildir = ~/mail
  ignore = *Spam,*foo/bar*

  [actions]
  default = Show mu4e
  Show mu4e = emacs -f mu4e
  Start thunderbird = thunderbird
